#Udacity PID project
The purpose of this project as to create a PID control that would steer a simulated car. 

The PID consist of 3 different parts.

1. **P**roportional,
This part is what actually do most of the work, it simply takes the error, multiply it with a constant and feed that directly into the system. One problem with this is that it's very likely to overshoot.
2. **I**ntegral,
This part will help to drag down the error if it stays there during a longer time by taking the sum of all error. This is slower to react but can be stronger. 
3. **d**erivate,
This part will help minimizing the overshoot caused by the **P** term, it does this by taking the difference between the current and previous error.


Appart from only doing the steering I also added in a PD control for the throttle, this will further help stabilize the car by slowing down in curves. for this I used the absolute value of the *Cross Track Error* (CTE).

When it comes to tuning the parameters there's many ways of doing it, one method that's not too bad is to just manually tune it. it goes pretty well and quick to get a pretty good result.

Another method mentioned in the class was to use *Twiddle*. It simply tries different values to see if it's better or not. This takes a long time in system like this.
One of the best ways would probably be to always start from beginning and then run one lap and get the score. However that would take a long time, so instead I let it run continuously around the track and only reset if the car get stuck or outside the track.

In the first version I made I only tuned the steering with the twiddle, that was pretty straight forward and simple, however when adding in the throttle pd controller it became a bit trickier, this due I also added speed into the error, so that the car would favor going a bit faster, otherwise the car would likely tune itself to always go slow.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
